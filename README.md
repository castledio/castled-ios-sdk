Castled iOS SDK provides integration capabilities for mobile applications running on iOS devices with the Castled Customer Engagement Platform. This SDK facilitates:
- Receiving push notifications.

The following steps will guide iOS app developers on how to seamlessly integrate the SDK into their mobile applications.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later

## üé¢ Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Castled into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Castled'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Castled as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/castledio/castled-ios-sdk", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.5.1"))
]
```
